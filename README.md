# VillanyLeo's odin-recipes project
### This is my _odin-recipes_ project.

**Introduction:**
Right now I'm a beginner web developer.
I'm quite good at HTML and CSS now, so I make relatively nice websites for the company I work for right now, but I don't know anything about JavaScript, and my back-end knowledge is also pretty basic. 

**Expectations:**
By the end of my Odin Project journey I would like to build websites that have animations, motion, variable elements through JavaScript and to have a backend knowledge that is not neccesarily based on PHP.
