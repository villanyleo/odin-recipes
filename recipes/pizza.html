    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400g type-00 pizza flour</li>
      <li>212g bread flour</li>
      <li>428g water (70% hydration)</li>
      <li>30g mature sourdough starter(5%)</li>
      <li>18g salt (3%)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Give your starter a 1:1:1 feeding. Weigh out the water in a large mixing
        bowl, then add the flour to form an autolyse (soaking the flour). Mix
        briefly, just to ensure all the flour has been hydrated. Cover autolyse
        and set aside to wait for your starter to peak (on average this takes
        3-4 hours).
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread starter on the surface of the dough and incorporate by kneading
        for 10 minutes by hand (Feng likes using the rubaud method). If using a
        mixer, mix on the lowest speed setting for 7 minutes, then allow to rest
        for 5 minutes before moving to the next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt and fold to incorporate for 3 minutes until the salt has
        dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        To easily monitor the fermentation, remove a small piece of dough to
        place in a small jar, marking its current volume using a rubber band.
        Cover dough and leave to rest for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough mass into a smooth ball by dragging across the counter
        surface to form tension on the surface of the dough. Allow the dough to
        continue bulk fermenting until your test dough sample has increased in
        volume by 10 - 15%. The time this takes will vary depending on your
        starter's activity and your room temperature, but as a reference, it can
        take 5 hours at 26°C. Once done, divide dough into 270g/9.5 Oz dough
        balls, place into an airtight container and store in the fridge for
        24-48 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove dough from the fridge 4 hours (6 hours in cold weather) to final
        proof at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open out a dough ball into a circular base, taking care to retain air in
        the crust. Add your favourite toppings. Bake in Roccbox or Dome at
        400°C/752°F at medium flame for 60-90 seconds until the colour you like.
        Enjoy!
